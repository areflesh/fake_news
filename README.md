### FAKE NEWS DETECTION 

#### Introduction 

In the rapidly evolving digital age, the proliferation of misinformation has become a pressing issue. The ability to distinguish between real and fake news has never been more critical. This report presents the development and implementation of a machine learning project aimed at detecting fake and real news. The project leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and different types of models to analyze and classify news articles.

The project utilizes a dataset of news articles labeled as ‘real’ or ‘fake’, which serves as the foundation for training our machine learning models. The report will delve into the specifics of the data preparation, model training, and evaluation processes, providing a comprehensive overview of the project’s methodology and results. The ultimate goal is to compare few model architecture and analyze which one can assist in the timely and accurate detection of fake news, thereby mitigating its potential harmful effects.
